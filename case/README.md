# AmaFi Case

The case is designed in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) and converted to g-code using [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).The step files for the 3D models can be downloaded directly and printed with a 3D printer:
* [case.stl](https://github.com/kamamautanu/AmaFi/blob/main/case/case.stl) - this is the main compartment that features pegs for mounting Permaboards and spots for 2 zip tie supports

* [bottom.stl](https://github.com/kamamautanu/AmaFi/blob/main/case/bottom.stl) - this is a cover that slides into the bottom of the case and features 6 - 1/2" circle cut outs to feed the sensor, solenoid, and power wiring through.

These models are parametric in design, so ? Here are a few pointers for anyone planning on 3D printing these pieces themselves:
* In 3D software, use a raft to increase adhesion and create supports everywhere to keep everything in place

* Depending on the 3D printer, the case will probably need to be rotated around in the 3D software to fit inside the printable area
