# AmaFi
Automated waterwise irrigation system

One day as I was doing my morning round in the garden watering, two thoughts came to mind, well three really:

1. I love my garden, but I spend so muc  


The effeciency of drip irrigation systems has been known for some time. In some systems, water usage can be reduced by 20 to 30%. In a world where water rations are no longer

# What is AmaFi?

I was inspired to create AmaFi to reduce the amount of time and water required by my garden.

# What is next for AmaFi?

Four words - going solar and wireless. That's right, now that I have a functioning system up and running I can focus on making improvements to my system. 

# Component Details

## 1.  Microprocessor 

For this project I chose the common microprocessor Raspberry Pi

## 2.  Case

Since the electronic components of this system are housed outdoors, thorough weatherproofing was especially imperative to the longevity of the device. With this in consideration, I decided to design a 3D enclosure in OpenSCAD and then used Cura to convert the model into 3D printable g-code. The enclosure has slots on the back for zip ties for easy securing, two pegs inside spaced to hold two half-sized Adafruit Permaboards, and a removable bottom with six 1/2 inch circle cutouts for wires and a small spot to use a screwdriver to pop the bottom out. For more information, the complete details can be found HERE. Since PLA is not UV resistant, I simply used some sand paper to abrade the exterior of the case and applied a coating of UV resistant ??? on the outside. 

## 3.  Soil Moisture Sensor

## 4.  Relay

## 5.  Solenoid Valve

## 6.  I2C Multiplexer

## 7.  Other electical components

Let's talk more weatherproofing. The system has some built in weatherproofing of electical components with the 3D enclosure 

## 8.  Backflow Preventer

Backflow preventers do exactly that - they prevent water from flowing backwards and back into the main water supply, thus preventing potential contamination.

## 9.  Water Pressure Regulator

In drip irrigation systems, water pressure regulators are essential for reducing water pressure to a level that the system can handle. Utilizing the correct water pressure for a drip system is important to assure that accurate volumes of water are applied and for the long-term longevity of the system. For most vegetable gardens and some other low-flow systems, a water pressure regulator that reduces water pressure to 25 PSI is adequate.
